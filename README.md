# smart-waste-bin

Creating a smart waste bin system using Python and machine learning is an ambitious project. Below is a simple version of such a project. It demonstrates the main functionalities and structure you'll need, but note that you'll need to expand on this in a real-world application, particularly around the machine learning model. For this example, I'll use a hypothetical waste classification based on image recognition data. You'll need an appropriate dataset and training framework for a real implementation.

### Requirements
1. Python 3.x
2. TensorFlow or PyTorch for machine learning
3. OpenCV for image capture or processing
4. Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation
5. Broad IoT platform integration capability (e.g., AWS or Azure)

import cv2
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf

### Considerations:
- **Dataset & Training**: You will need a dataset with images of waste items labeled as recyclable, compostable, and landfill. Then, use this dataset to train a machine learning model.
- **Model Complexity**: This script assumes a simple pre-trained model. In practice, model training and tuning are complex and require a solid understanding of machine learning techniques.
- **IoT Integration**: The script should be integrated into a larger IoT system to fully automate waste management, involving sensors, actuators, and possibly cloud-based analytics and control systems.
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling is crucial, especially when dealing with real-world hardware interactions.

Use this as a starting point and expand each component according to specific project requirements and real-world integration scenarios.
